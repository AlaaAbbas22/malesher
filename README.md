# Malesher

'“Malesh” springs from ما عليه شيء , which literally means “there's nothing on it or someone.” Picture saying this with a light-hearted shrug—it's all about brushing off the small stuff with a smile. The phrase is typically used when someone's goofed up but in a way that's more clueless than catastrophic.'
